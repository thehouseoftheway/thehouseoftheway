                <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 5 stars</p>
                <p>I really enjoyed my time here. My review will be coloured by the fact that I was the only guest during my stay due to giving staff time off for Christmas. I had the entire top floor to myself which was extraordinary.</p>

                <p>Celi's place is set for a KING or QUEEN ðŸ‘‘. I have been with Airbnb for over 20 years. Celi and her staff are #1 in my book...</p>

                <p>Mam Celi is a great host will definitely back here when we visited Roxas...</p>

                <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4 stars</p>
                <p>great place and nearby for public transportation, mall and restaurants the place was quite peaceful and with beautiful view of plants surrounded in the area and also strong internet connections while working and the host ma'am celi was very kind.</p>

                <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 5 stars</p>
                <p>The place and accommodation is awesome. Check in and check out time is very flexible. The host has been very terrific and would even lend hands if needed. very peaceful. Highly recommended.</p>

                <h4>Ericson </h4>
                <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4 stars</p>
                <p>I have no words â€” Mam Celi hosted me and welcomed me to her home and family with a lot of warmth and hospitality. I was traveling solo around Panay Island but it felt like I came home to old friends and family in Roxas City. Outside of that, the room was clean and well-maintained. The sheets and pillows smelled great, the amenities topnotch. I would like to return with family and friends another time and would definitely choose to be hosted again at The House of the Way.</p>

                <h4>Brandon </h4>
                <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 5 stars</p>
                <p>The place is indeed a "safe haven" for me. While I was here I found serenity just like home - felt at peace, composed and unbothered. Plants took a special part but Maam Celi's big smile and warm welcome made my stay beyond luxury.</p>

                <h4>Francis </h4>
                <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4 stars</p>
                <p>It is such a great stay! The room and kitchen is really well-equipped and very comfortable. All the amenities are in top condition. The roof garden is especially lovely to hang out in, and the area is peaceful and quiet.</p>

                <h4>Lowela</h4>
                <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 5 stars</p>
                <p>Without a doubt, one of the best Airbnbs I have ever stayed at. Celi is a very kind and considerate host who goes out of her way to make you feel comfortable. The entire facility is sparkling clean and the rooftop terrace with its greenery is a nice respite after a long day.</p>
